## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  I currently own a Windows computer and do not have access to an Apple computer which is needed to get access to XCode. I spent about two weeks to get access
  to a Mac OS to complete the project by setting up a virtual Mac OS. After being able to solve all the problems I had to run into including getting access to a Mac OS image for the most up to date OS version of Mac possible, I was finally able to successfully run a working virtual Mac OS System on my Windows computer. This was finally completed on January 6th, 2017 just hours before the submit deadline. Under pressure I still continued with the Pre-Work. I quickly tried getting familiar with Swift which I had no knowledge bforehand. Despite the time pressure, I was definitely having fun playing around with XCode and Swift Playground. I will definitely continue improving my Tip Calculator app by integrating the optional objectives and integrating my own touch to it. I would like to thank CodePath for the giving me this opportunity because I learned so much more than just basic Swift programming but I was taken out my comfort zone by experimenting with an OS system I never had experience with in order to get Mac OS X setup on my Windows computer and having to learn Command Prompt commands to do so. Then having to get quickly adjusted to Mac's interface since I never touched an iMac in my life till this virtual machine I set up. In Conclusion, there were far more lessons learned here for me than just making an iOS Tip Calculator app.
